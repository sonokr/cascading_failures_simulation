This module contains the core methods used to uniformly sample graphs with
fixed degree sequences via a double edge swap Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler.

"""
#
# There are two primary ways to utilize this module, either though providing and
# maintaining a networkx graph/multigraph object as in MCMC_class, or by providing
# and maintaining an adjacency matrix and an edge list as in the functions
# MCMC_step_stub and MCMC_step_vertex. In either approach it is necessary to specify
# the desired graph space by stating whether self-loops and/or multiedges are
# allowed as well deciding whether the graph is stub- or vertex-labeled.
#
# For a list of function arguments please see the function's specific
# documentation.
#
# MCMC_step_vertex and MCMC_step_stub
# -------------------------------
#
# Functions MCMC_step_stub and MCMC_step_vertex perform a single stub-labeled and
# vertex-labeled (respectively) double edge swap and correspond to Algorithms 1
# and 3 in the accompanying paper. These functions modify a full (non-sparse)
# graph adjacency matrix, a list of edges, and a length 4 list, all in place.
# Both take the same arguments (as detailed below).
#
#    Example:
#
#::
#
#  import numpy as np
#  A = np.array([[0,1,0],[1,2,2],[0,2,0 ]])
#  edge_list = np.array([[0,1],[1,2],[1,2],[1,1]])
#  swaps = [0,0,0,0]
#  MCMC_step_stub(A, edge_list, swaps, allow_loops = True, allow_multi = True)
#
# This performs a single MCMC step on a stub-labeled loopy multigraph,
# potentially updating A, edge_list and swap with new, post-swap values.
#
# Both functions return a boolean, which is true only if the Markov chain step
# altered the adjacency matrix (as opposed to resampling the current graph).
# If the adjacency matrix is altered the swaps argument will be changed in place,
# storing the nodes that were swapped.
#
# MCMC_class
# ----------
#
# The MCMC_class is initialized with a networkx graph, along with the three choices
# that define the graph space.  Calling the class function 'step_and_get_graph'
# advances the Markov chain and returns the current networkx graph
#
#    Example:
#
#::
#
#  import networkx as nx
#  G = nx.Graph()
#  G.add_path([0,1,2,3,4])
#  MC = MCMC_class(G, allow_loops = True, allow_multi = True, is_v_labeled = False)
#  G2 = MC.step_and_get_graph()
#
# This takes a path graph on 4 nodes, instantiates a MCMC_class based on this
# graph and returns a pointer to a graph G2 which differs from G by one double
# edge swap. Notice that this samples from the space of stub-labeled loopy
# multigraphs, but can be easily adjusted to other spaces.
#
#
# Notes
# -----
# In general, directly calling MCMC_step_vertex or MCMC_step_stub is faster than
# using MCMC_class, since updating networkx data structures doesn't benefit
# from numba acceleration.
#
# For large graphs, the full adjacency matrix may not be able to be stored
# in memory. If so, the ‘@nb.jit’ function decorator can be deleted and a sparse
# matrix can be passed into these functions as an argument, though at a
# significant cost in speed.
#
# We use the convention that a self-loop (u,u) contributes 2 to the diagonal of
# an adjacency matrix, not 1 as in Networkx.

    This method currently requires a full adjacency matrix. Adjusting this
    to work a sparse adjacency matrix simply requires removing the '@jit'
    decorator.  This method supports loopy graphs, but depending on the degree
    sequence, it may not be able to sample from all loopy graphs.
